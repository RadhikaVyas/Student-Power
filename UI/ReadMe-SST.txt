1 -> Make files with same name as in folder.
2 -> For design purpose, the images are same just with different names. So, we'll have to update them only. Hence, use reference name only.
3 -> Try to maintain sizes from image. Specify width in % & font-size & height in em.

Use em by trial & error. Call me in case of any mis-understanding.
